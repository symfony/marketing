The Symfony Website Content
===========================

This repository hosts most the content of the symfony.com webiste.

This is where you should submit pull requests if you find a typo somewhere on the Symfony website, or if you want
to translate its content to another language.

To translate the content in another language, just create a new directory named after the locale (es for Spanish for instance), and re-create the same directory/file structure.

You don't need to translate everything in one pull request. When a user encounters a non translated page, it will have the choice to fallback to the same page in English in in any other translated language.
