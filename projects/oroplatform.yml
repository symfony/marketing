    The OroPlatform is an Open source Business Application Platform (BAP).
    It offers developers the exact business application platform they've
    been looking for, by combining the tools they need. Built in PHP5 and
    the Symfony framework, it seamlessly integrates into OroCRM or works
    entirely standalone. Developing custom business applications has never
    been so easy.
