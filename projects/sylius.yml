    Sylius is an open source e-commerce solution for PHP, based on the
    Symfony framework. Ultimate goal of the project is to create a webshop
    engine, which is user-friendly, loved by developers and has a helpful
    community. Sylius is constructed from fully decoupled components
    (bundles in Symfony glossary), which means that every feature
    (products catalog, shipping engine, promotions system...) can be used
    in any other application.
