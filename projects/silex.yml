    Silex is a PHP microframework for PHP 5.3. It is built on the shoulders
    of Symfony and Pimple and also inspired by Sinatra. A microframework
    provides the guts for building simple single-file apps. Silex aims to
    be: concise (it exposes an intuitive and concise API that is fun to
    use), extensible (it has an extension system based around the Pimple
    micro service-container that makes it even easier to tie in third party
    libraries) and testable (it uses Symfony's HttpKernel, which abstracts
    request and response and simplifies app testing).
