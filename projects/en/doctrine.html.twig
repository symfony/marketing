    <p>

        Object relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that sits on top of a powerful
        database abstraction layer (DBAL). One of its key features is the
        option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL
        dialect called Doctrine Query Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernates
        HQL. This provides developers with a powerful alternative to SQL that
        maintains flexibility without requiring unnecessary code duplication.
