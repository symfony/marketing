        Propel is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for SQL-
        Databases in PHP 5.4. It allows you to access your database using a
        set of objects, providing a simple API for storing and retrieving
        data. But not only plain ORM but it also provides database schema
        migration, reverse engineering of existing database and much more.
