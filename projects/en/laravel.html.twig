    <p>Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable,
    creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks
    used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching. Laravel aims to make the
    development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make
    the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including
    frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.</p>
